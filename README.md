# Platt Demo

- As JavaScript framework I used Vue@3 with custom hooks since Platt uses Vue for most the work
- I decided to use tailwindcss for utility classes since I had only had a couple of days to finish the demo due to email issues.
- I used plain css for all main layout and main components to demonstrate css skills
- I also used mix @apply mixins and css variables
